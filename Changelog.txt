	KCV Change Log
========================

Prototype r199 - 1/30/2014
	* KCV should no longer be showing javascript errors. You'll still get popups from DMM's main website however.
	* Translation: If you still get "Adopted Ship Girls" it should now be "Ship Girl Roster".
	* Typo: Kiso Kai 2 no longer has a space in her name.
	* Main Branch: Various minor changes in the way colors are displayed.
